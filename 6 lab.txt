Analyzing Sales Data from Multiple File Formats:
Analyzing sales data from various file formats is a common challenge in data analytics and 
business intelligence. Sales data can be collected and stored in different formats, such as 
CSV, Excel, JSON, or even databases. The primary goal of this analysis is to consolidate, 
clean, and analyze sales data to derive valuable insights for informed decision-making.
Data Integration and Cleaning:
One of the initial tasks is to integrate data from various formats into a unified dataset. This 
may involve converting Excel files, parsing JSON, and loading CSV data. Cleaning the data 
is crucial to address issues like missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.
Sales Performance Analysis:
Once the data is harmonized and cleaned, it can be used to perform sales performance 
analysis. This involves tasks like calculating revenue, profit margins, and identifying topselling products or regions. Visualization techniques are often employed to present these 
insights effectively.

Business Decision Support:
Analyzing sales data from multiple file formats serves as a foundation for informed business 
decisions. Retailers can use these insights to improve inventory management, optimize 
marketing strategies, and enhance overall profitability. The ability to work with diverse data 
formats equips analysts and data scientists with a versatile skill set, ensuring they can handle 
data from a wide range of sources.
Description: The goal is to load and analyze sales data from different file formats, including 
CSV, Excel, and JSON, and perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis on the 
dataset.

Tasks to Perform:
1. Obtain sales data files in various formats, such as CSV, Excel, and JSON.
2. Load the sales data from each file format into the appropriate data structures or 
dataframes.
3. Explore the structure and content of the loaded data, identifying any inconsistencies, 
missing values, or data quality issues.
4. Perform data cleaning operations, such as handling missing values, removing 
duplicates, or correcting inconsistencies.
5. Convert the data into a unified format, such as a common dataframe or data structure, 
to enable seamless analysis.

8. Perform data transformation tasks, such as merging multiple datasets, splitting 
columns, or deriving new variables.
9. Analyze the sales data by performing descriptive statistics, aggregating data by 
specific variables, or calculating metrics such as total sales, average order value, or 
product category distribution.
10. Create visualizations, such as bar plots, pie charts, or box plots, to represent the sales 
data and gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, or product performance.

Conclusion:
In this lab, we addressed the challenge of analyzing sales data stored in multiple file 
formats, including CSV, Excel, and JSON. Our journey began by obtaining these data files and 
loading them into appropriate data structures, followed by a meticulous exploration of their 
structure and content to ensure data quality.To ensure data consistency, we performed 
cleaning and transformation operations, which included handling missing values, removing 
duplicates, and converting the data into a unified format. This prepared the dataset for 
analysis, where we calculated metrics, aggregated data, and visualized insights using 
techniques such as bar plots, pie charts, and box plots.
The ability to work with diverse data formats and extract valuable insights equips data 
analysts and scientists with versatile skills, enabling them to make informed business 
decisions, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance overall profitability.
